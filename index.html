                        It’s often said that you don’t truly understand something until you can teach it 
                        to someone else. But I believe the real test of understanding is being able to teach it to a computer.
                       </p>

                       <p> 
                        <b>So, how exactly do you teach something to a computer?</b>
                        <i>How do you command a machine and feel that thrill when it obeys?</i>
                       </p>

                        <p>
                            Well, keep in mind—your computer doesn’t speak your native language.
                            It doesn’t understand English, French, or any human language.
                        </p>

                            At its core, computer programming is the process of writing a 
                            set of instructions that a computer can understand and execute.
                        </p>

                        <p>With computer programs, you can:</p>

                        In essence, programming is the language of creation in the

                        You might be asking, <strong>“Why do I need to learn coding just to build a website? Aren’t there platforms where I can drag and drop components and have a website ready in minutes?”</strong>

                      <p>
                        Absolutely—those platforms exist, and they’re incredibly useful. But this course isn’t just about building simple websites.

                      <p>
                        It’s about understanding how technology works from the inside out. It’s a stepping stone into the vast world of tech—software development, automation, artificial intelligence, app creation, and digital problem-solving.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Learning to code is like learning how to think differently. It equips you with problem-solving tools that will be relevant whether you're building a blog, launching a startup, analyzing data, or even writing legal tech tools.

                        “I think everybody should learn how to program a computer and learn computer language. Because it teaches you how to think in a certain way.”

                      <blockquote>
                        “Programming is where you are describing to the machine how to do something—telling it how to play tic-tac-toe, how to play the board game Monopoly, how to convert numbers from one base to another. The fact of understanding how the computer works gives you a real sense of what it can do and what it can't do.”
                      </blockquote>

                        If you’ve ever used a smartphone, computer, or even a smartwatch, then you’ve already touched the surface of what tech can do.
                        But if you really want to understand <strong>what’s under the hood</strong>, and how these tools are made—<strong>coding is your gateway.</strong>

                      <blockquote>

                        <h3>HTML – The Structure</h3>

                        <img src="./img/html_car.jpg" alt="HTML Car">

                        <p>
                            Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the foundation of every web page. 
                            Think of it like the skeleton of a car, as shown in the first image above.
                            Without the skeleton, there's no place to attach the tires, brake lights, or engine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Similarly, HTML creates the framework of a web page—it defines what shows up and where.
                            But just like no one wants to drive around in a bare metal frame, a plain HTML page isn’t very attractive. That’s where CSS comes in.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Example: Output of HTML without CSS</h4>
                        <p>Click <i><b>"Run code"</b></i> to display output</p>

                        <article>
                            <div class="example example-code">
                                <div class="code-header">
                                    <div>HTML code</div>
                                    <button class="run-btn">Run code</button>
                                </div>

                                <div class="code-content">
                                    <img src="./img/html1_code.png" alt="">
                                </div>

                                </div>

                            </div>

                        </article>

                        <hr>

                        <h3>CSS – The Styling</h3>

                        <img src="./img/css_car.jpg" alt="CSS Car">

                        <p>
                            Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) gives life and beauty to the structure created by HTML. It’s like painting the car, installing leather seats, and adding those sleek headlights.
                        </p>
                        <!-- <p>
                            The second image shows what styling can do. Both pictures have the same HTML, but their appearances are entirely different—all thanks to CSS.
                        </p> -->
                        <p>
                            So if HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the beauty and polish that make everything visually appealing.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Example:</h4>
                        <p>Click <i><b>"Run code"</b></i> to display output</p>

                            That’s the role of JavaScript.

                            JavaScript makes websites interactive and responsive to user actions—clicking buttons, submitting forms, triggering animations, and more.
